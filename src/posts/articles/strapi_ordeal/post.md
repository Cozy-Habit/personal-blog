# Strapi Ordeal

My goal with this post is to be to be open and real about my journey as a software engineer. This means sharing not only solutions and coding skills, but also problems and setbacks. Everyone started somewhere in their career and had to face common struggles which made them question their own competence and fit as a software engineer in the field. I am sure a lot of devs have felt like an imposter once in a while, unaware that they are self-sabotaging themselves at times. Well, I've been there and I am still going through that constantly. And I want to share one of those situations, where my stubborness made me neglect my health and from which I should take away some valuable lessons.

It was a chilly Saturday. I opened my laptop at 3pm as I wanted to work on my portfolio/blog to streamline my content management process. I heard about Strapi, which is a headless Content Management System (CMS). Headless means... . "Sweet, let's just try that." I thought to myself. I read the docs where they incorporated their supscription for Strapi Cloud into the set-up tutorial. I rolled my eyes, because what does almost every student struggle with? Exactly. ✨ Money ✨

That's why I am always on the look out for open-source and free tools to enhance my software projects. So instead of hosting Strapi in their cloud I wanted to bring my Github Educational Student Pack to good use and utilize the 200€ Credits from DigitalOcean for cloud hosting.

I had watched some episodes of Euphoria (amazing but unnerving tv show) with a friend of mine the evening before.
But those who grit their teeth and persevere no matter the hours of debugging and the following frustration when you have to give up
